            Hello! I am Kent. I'm currently a 4th year at Keio University majoring in marketing and computer science.
            
            I specialize in front end web development with React.js and I am knowledgable of IOS mobile development, Node, MongoDB, Express, Python, and Java.

            I also have experience using shopify and social media marketing such as facebook ads.

            My goal after University is to excel in a career that I am passionate in and give back to the community and everyone that has supported me to this point.

            I am an avid cellist, soccer player, and hiker.
